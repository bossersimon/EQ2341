    "2. Use your Markov chain rand function to generate a sequence of $T = 10000$ state integer numbers from the test Markov chain. Calculate the relative frequency of occurrences of $S_t = 1$ and $S_t = 2$. The relative frequencies should of course be approximately equal to $P(S_t)$.\n",

The conditional expectation formulas $\\mu_X = E[X] = E_Z [E_X [X|Z]]$ and $var [X] = E_Z [var_X [X|Z]] + var_Z [E_X [X|Z]]$ apply generally whenever some variable $X$ depends on another variable $Z$ and may be useful for the calculations. Then use your HMM rand function to generate a sequence of $T = 10000$ output scalar random numbers $x = (x_1 \\dots x_t \\dots x_T)$ from the given HMM test example. Use the standard Numpy functions $np.mean()$ and $np.var()$ to calculate the mean and variance of your generated sequence. The result should agree approximately with your theoretical values.\n",
    "4. To get an impression of how the HMM behaves, use @HMM/rand to generate a series of $500$ contiguous samples $X_t$ from the HMM, and plot them as a function of $t$. Do this many times until you have a good idea of what characterizes typical output of this HMM, and what structure there is to the randomness. Describe the behaviour in one or two sentences in your report. Also include one such plot in the report, labelled using title, xlabel, and ylabel to clearly show which variable is plotted along which axis. You should do this for every plot in the course project.\n",
    "5. Create a new HMM, identical to the previous one except that it has $\\mu_2 = \\mu_1 = 0$. Generate and plot $500$ contiguous values several times using @HMM/rand for this HMM. What is similar about how the two HMMs behave? What is different with this new HMM? Is it possible to estimate the state sequence $S$ of the underlying Markov chain from the observed output variables $x$ in this case?\n",
    "6. Another aspect you must check is that your rand-function works for _finite-duration_ HMMs. Define a new test HMM of your own and verify that your function returns reasonable results.\n",
    "7. Finally, your rand function should work also when the state-conditional output distributions generate random vectors. Define a new test HMM of your own where the outputs are Gaussian vector distributions, and verify that this also works with your code. (Note that a single instance of the GaussD class is capable of generating vector output; stacking several GaussD-objects is not correct.) At least one of the output distributions should have a non-diagonal covariance matrix such as\n",
